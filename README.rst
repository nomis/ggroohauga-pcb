Logitech® Z906 Surround Sound Speakers
======================================

Overview
--------

PCB for an alternative console and simulated amplifier interface for the
ESP32-S3 microcontroller interacting with Logitech® Z906 Surround Sound
Speakers.

Purpose
-------

Provide an unofficial alternative console (to control the amplifier directly
without the original console) and simulated amplifier interface (to indirectly
control an amplifier with the original console).

Usage
-----

This project is made up of 3 KiCad projects, each of which share the same
schematic file. These projects depend on support for symbolic links (which
can be enabled in Developer Mode if you're using Windows).
